# Social Media Agent System Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an open-source social media agent system designed to manage content across multiple platforms. The system will employ a team structure with one team leader and four specialized team members, each responsible for a specific social media platform.

## Team Structure
1. **Team Leader Agent**
   - Coordinates activities across all platform-specific agents
   - Aggregates performance metrics
   - Generates weekly progress reports
   - Makes strategic decisions about content distribution
   - Manages scheduling and content calendar

2. **Platform-Specific Agents**
   - Facebook Agent
   - X (Twitter) Agent
   - Instagram Agent
   - TikTok Agent
